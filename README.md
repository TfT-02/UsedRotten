UsedRotten
==========

Making Rotten Flesh useful in Bukkit.

This is a very simple plugin for Bukkit.  Others have done it, but have lagged a bit behind bukkit updates.

It adds:
 - 4 rotten flesh in a 2x2 pattern on a crafting table will make 1 leather.
 - Rotten Flesh is also now cookable in a furnace to make leather.

Permission:
 - The permission UsedRotten.Crafting allows people to craft flesh to leather.
 - Working on a furnace permission, but none yet.

File:
 - Plugin jar file is available at https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bxs-2GyuqfD9VVhhaFU4dW43eFk/

Install:
 - Download the jar file and place in server plugins directory.
 - Add permission for crafting if desired.

Written for CraftBukkit Beta Build (1.7.2-R0.3)
 
To do:

 - Add furnace permissions
 - Add crafting variations for flexibility
 - See if I can get a furnace to consume more than 1 flesh per leather created.
 - Allow one or both to be used via configuration file
 - Allow configuration of output for both using a furnace or a Crafting Table
