Making Rotten Flesh useful in Bukkit.

This is a very simple plugin for Bukkit.  Others have done it, but have lagged a bit behind bukkit updates.

It adds:
 - 4 rotten flesh in a 2x2 pattern on a crafting table will make 1 leather.
 - Rotten Flesh is also now cookable in a furnace to make leather.

Written for CraftBukkit Beta Build (1.7.2-R0.3)
 
To do:

 - Add permissions
 - Add crafting variations for flexibility
 - See if I can get a furnace to consume more than 1 flesh per leather created.
 - Allow one or both to be used via configuration file
